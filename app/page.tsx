                  <div>• Engineered a pipeline allowing users to go from image upload to a lit, posed 3D mannequin in seconds vs workflows that take minutes in traditional software..</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">Design Note: The core thesis is speed to value. Artists needing pose references shouldn&apos;t have to fight complex 3D software. This entire project is architected around collapsing the time it takes to get a useful, well-lit reference, making it an ergonomic, lightweight alternative to the status quo.</div>

                  Modal, refactoring 2021 command-line research code and resolving legacy PyTorch/NumPy dependency conflicts.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">The Challenge: The original research code was powerful but production-hostile. It was a tangle of CLI dependencies and version conflicts. The main work was refactoring this into a containerized, reliable, and scalable web service that could form the backbone of a real product.</div>
                </li>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">Insight: A 45-second cold start is a dealbreaker for an interactive tool. The key to this 78% reduction was a two-stage loading process and implementing Modal&apos;s memory snapshots, proving that thoughtful serverless architecture can deliver a near-native user experience.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">The Trade-off: Instead of relying solely on the expensive GPU model, this pipeline uses a cost-effective multimodal LLM as a &quot;sanity check&quot; and validation layer. It&apos;s a novel approach that improves robustness while dramatically reducing cost—a critical consideration for any real-world AI product.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">Architectural Goal: Performance and stability were non-negotiable. Many web-based 3D tools lag or crash browsers under load. This editor was architected from the ground up to be lightweight, delivering a stable 60fps+ experience by creating a hybrid system that intelligently routes different image types to the optimal model (client-side MediaPipe vs. custom backend).</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">Vercel&apos;s database pricing was getting expensive as the project grew. Migrated everything to Supabase using pg_dump to ensure 100% data integrity. The migration went smoothly and now I get way more database features for a fraction of the cost.</div>

                  <div>• Reduced request latency from 300ms to 50ms through optimized queries, indexing, and TanStack Query caching.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">The original setup was doing way too many database round trips. I added proper indexing on frequently queried columns, restructured some of the more complex queries, and implemented aggressive caching with TanStack Query. The 50ms response time made the whole app feel snappy.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div>• Built novel bidirectional looping infinite scrolling system with Three.js and React Three Fiber, preserving native browser functionality while solving edge-case behaviours with accessibility-focused DOM overrides</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">The Challenge: The goal was to build an infinite scroll system that didn&apos;t break the web. Most libraries hijack the scrollbar and disable native browser functionality. This implementation was a deep dive into custom DOM manipulation to preserve features like browser history and scroll restoration, making it feel seamless and native.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div>• Built rich text editor with TipTap and Zustand with persistent drafts, keyboard shortcuts, and stateful editing.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">Architectural Decision: This was an exercise in building a decoupled, distributed system. Offloading image processing to a dedicated Go microservice (detailed in the Potato Image Compressor project) improved the main app&apos;s scalability and maintainability, separating concerns for a more robust backend.</div>
                </li>

                  <div>• Ensured type-safe client-server JSON data with Zod schema validation and Next.js Server Actions.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">I turned this off for now, but it was nice when I tried it a while ago. Rather than making users manually tag everything, I integrated Claude&apos;s API to analyze content and suggest relevant tags. It&apos;s surprisingly good at understanding context and suggesting useful categorization that actually improves search and organization.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This was a fun project. I wanted to learn Go, and I thought it would be a good idea to build an image processing pipeline. It was simpler when I initially added it a few months into the Scrapbook project, and it was a couple months later that I really thought to dig deep and make this bigger and better and faster and flashier. I used goroutines with worker pools and sync primitives (both semaphores and mutexes) to make it concurrent and efficient. Oh, and I wanted to try out gRPC too. It&apos;s not the most complex thing, but it was a good exercise in Go.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">I wanted to use k6 because it seemed like some sort of industry standard, but I ended up doing the bulk of the testing with shell scripts... which seems like what k6 kinda does anyway, at least for my case here. Anyway, the baseline was also this supremely naive, sequential little thing. Which I don&apos;t think I even had? Like, I&apos;m pretty sure it was already async/await (in go terms) from the start..</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This was a fun challenge. I wanted to make the image processing pipeline more flexible and extensible, so I designed it with a modular architecture in mind. This way, I could easily swap out different compression strategies (like libvips) without having to rewrite a lot of code. It was a good exercise in software design principles.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This was another interesting challenge. I wanted to make the image processing pipeline accessible over the network, so I used the Adapter Pattern to expose its functionality via HTTP and gRPC.
