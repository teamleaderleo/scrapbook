                  <div>• Fixed dark mode styling in Next.js development tools, improving accessibility for 4.9M+ developers, merged in #80025.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This was actually a pretty straightforward fix, but has theoretical massive impact. The dev tools preferences were uncomfortable to look at, since it was white text on a white background. I dug into their design system and found they had the right CSS variables, but they just weren&apos;t being applied on the options.</div>

                  <div>• Improved Next.js App Router internals by refactoring an unhandled redirect handler to use direct dispatch methods, aligning with architectural best practices and addressing an existing TODO in #80075.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This hasn&apos;t been merged yet. I&apos;m not sure if I made changes in line with the maintainers&apos; intentions, but... there was a TODO comment in the codebase for 2 months about cleaning up redirect handling. I refactored it to use direct dispatch methods instead of the public API instance. There&apos;s some other work that could be done in that file as well, but I want to see how their test runner works before I go further. Well, I already have, but I want to verify my theoretical changes won&apos;t break anything..</div>

                  <div>• Analyzed Next.js internal architecture to diagnose call stack limitations in static export functionality for sites with 100k+ pages, then proposed and implemented a proactive warning system that prevents build scalability failures in #80037.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This is still open. Next.js inherently does a lot on its own, and processing pages for  static export can cause large sites to hit the JavaScript&apos;s call stack limit. I traced through the export pipeline, found the build calls, and implemented a warning system that catches this as builds fail. I think it might be decent to elucidate on design principles in the warning, but who knows; Vercel might decide to suddenly pivot/support big SSG.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">The blog part is it. We&apos;re still working on trying out different designs/libraries, but I personally just prefer dense information and non-functional art. So... everything and nothing.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">Vercel&apos;s database pricing was getting expensive as the project grew. Migrated everything to Supabase using pg_dump to ensure 100% data integrity. The migration went smoothly and now I get way more database features for a fraction of the cost.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div>• Reduced request latency from 300ms to 50ms through optimized queries, indexing, and TanStack Query caching.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">The original setup was doing way too many database round trips. I added proper indexing on frequently queried columns, restructured some of the more complex queries, and implemented aggressive caching with TanStack Query. The 50ms response time made the whole app feel snappy.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div>• Built novel bidirectional looping infinite scrolling system with Three.js and React Three Fiber, preserving native browser functionality while solving edge-case behaviours with accessibility-focused DOM overrides</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This was probably the most technically challenging part of the whole project. Most infinite scroll libraries break native browser behavior - you lose things like browser back/forward, scroll restoration, etc. I needed bidirectional scrolling (up and down infinitely) while preserving all that native functionality. Had to do custom DOM manipulation and careful event handling to make it work seamlessly.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div>• Built rich text editor with TipTap and Zustand with persistent drafts, keyboard shortcuts, and stateful editing.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This is in the App portion. It was really, really hard to achieve even half of the Discord-level usability, because there is just so much state management.</div>

                <li>
                  <div>• Offloaded image processing to Go microservice (Docker, Lambda, REST API Gateway) for distributed backend.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This is me thinking of justifiable ways to work with distributed systems. By offloading image processing to a dedicated microservice, I was able to decouple the image processing logic from the main application, making it easier to scale and maintain. Further notes are in the Potato Image Compressor section itself.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div>• Ensured type-safe client-server JSON data with Zod schema validation and Next.js Server Actions.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This is pretty basic. I used Drizzle, too. Like, it&apos;s just adding more types and stuff..</div>

                <li>
                  <div>• Used Claude LLM API to auto-suggest tags and categorize content, improving metadata search UX.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">I turned this off for now, but it was nice when I tried it a while ago. Rather than making users manually tag everything, I integrated Claude&apos;s API to analyze content and suggest relevant tags. It&apos;s surprisingly good at understanding context and suggesting useful categorization that actually improves search and organization.</div>
                </li>

                  <div>• Integrated OAuth 2.0 with GitHub/Google/email for secure user login and personalized content access.</div>

                  <div>• Developed full-stack features from DB schema to Tailwind CSS UI, iterating on Figma designs and peer feedback.</div>
                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">I asked my mom to look at my previous versions.

                <li>
                  <div>• Built Playwright/Vitest testing pipeline to troubleshoot and debug async state issues for CI stability.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This was a fun project. I wanted to learn Go, and I thought it would be a good idea to build an image processing pipeline. It was simpler when I initially added it a few months into the Scrapbook project, and it was a couple months later that I really thought to dig deep and make this bigger and better and faster and flashier. I used goroutines with worker pools and sync primitives (both semaphores and mutexes) to make it concurrent and efficient. Oh, and I wanted to try out gRPC too. It&apos;s not the most complex thing, but it was a good exercise in Go.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">I wanted to use k6 because it seemed like some sort of industry standard, but I ended up doing the bulk of the testing with shell scripts... which seems like what k6 kinda does anyway, at least for my case here. Anyway, the baseline was also this supremely naive, sequential little thing. Which I don&apos;t think I even had? Like, I&apos;m pretty sure it was already async/await (in go terms) from the start..</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This was a fun challenge. I wanted to make the image processing pipeline more flexible and extensible, so I designed it with a modular architecture in mind. This way, I could easily swap out different compression strategies (like libvips) without having to rewrite a lot of code. It was a good exercise in software design principles.</div>

                  <div className="ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-700">This was another interesting challenge. I wanted to make the image processing pipeline accessible over the network, so I used the Adapter Pattern to expose its functionality via HTTP and gRPC. I also set up monitoring and metrics tracking using Prometheus and Grafana, along with some shell tooling to make it easier to work with. It was a good way to learn about distributed systems and observability.</div>
