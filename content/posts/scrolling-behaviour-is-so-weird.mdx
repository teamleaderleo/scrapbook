blurb: I want freedom and also accessibility...

I want freedom and also accessibility in my scrollbar behaviours. Or, more aptly, the behaviours surrounding scrolling and navigating around the page.
But there's so much stuff to override! There are so many little things that go into the scrollbar/handle/thumb. Thumb? That's what it's called?

I guess it makes sense? There's an entire ecosystem that it ferments in. I have a lot more to say, but my recent explorations have been enlightening.
I didn't know there'd be more to learn... after I'd already learned about and given up on virtualization many months ago.
