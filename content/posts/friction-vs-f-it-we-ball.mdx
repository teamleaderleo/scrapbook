There are so many little improvements that nip at our heels, it's almost uncanny. At some point, we've settled in to the point of feeling that not only have we sunk into the piranha tanks, but that we've actually become a piranha ourselves. What are we, if not exploratory little fishies trawling and nibbling away at anything remotely edible? Maybe there's a big prize, maybe not. It doesn't matter.

Here are a few things we really need to nibble at/work on:

1. Reading and reviewing and reacting (even if a bit insipidly) to books and blog posts. Just go for it. I like reading my old stuff. It's all capsules.
2. Integrating Git Inline more. Showing it off as a demo. All we need to do is to cache the requests so I don't get rate limited. Then we'll keep working on it.
3. Some sorta pdf reader/whatever so that things link up nicely. Footnotes, links, whatever. Notably so I don't have to copy + paste each time I update my resume, which is quite often, but also to shift gradually into being more adept at handling data transformations.
4. A nicer, more innovative graph-based node-based UI. Like a tower defense map for a game. Like Kingdom Rush. That was cute.
5. A more open, realtime-ish updating mechanism for our... activities? Whatever, some stuff might be embarassing/cring to reveal, but there's at least one thing we can show every day, yeah? That's why it's called a Scrapbook, anyways.
6. Some sorta weekly activity-nudging thing so that my db doesn't get turned offline all the time.
7. Turning on guest mode or whatever so dudes can't just suddenly type a bunch of stuff in. Just witness, please...
8. On a similar note, bring in the issue tracking inline too. 200+ really good ideas are in the repo. Nice thoughts, nice etc. Maybe there are interesting things we can do wrt 
9. Highlighting text? More WYSIWYG type stuff. VSCode as a text editor for writing is certainly... a choice.
10. More modular, swappable displays... I actually wanna see animations here, and interactivity.
11. Go learn more from those Behance/Unsplash things. Really need to learn more from them before making compelling critiques.
12. More previews. More linking states.
