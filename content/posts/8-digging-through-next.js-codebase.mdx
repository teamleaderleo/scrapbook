I looked a couple thousands lines of code. I felt that looking at some of the TODOs and trying to figure out what they meant,

but also the broader contextual decisions that made them up, seemed like a good idea.


I then used those justifications to look at blames and PR history and commit history.

I feel like there's further justification now to look at running the tests more often, and seeing what else we might be able to find.

Profile stuff, all that.

Recently, I thought about Contexts and Providers and Consumers. I need to look at the React state tree and see what exactly costs what.
